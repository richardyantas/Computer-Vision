    1.- 8 february: Detection Algorithm of the pattern calibration 
    2.- 15february: The same but in real time 
    3.- 22february: Initial Calibration to camera
    4.- 01march:    Implementation of frontal transformation - parallel, detection and refinement of control points of the grid of concentric circles
    5.- 08march:    Optimization of the calibration camera
    6.- 15march:    Detection in real time of the pattern in differents cameras and comparison the results among groups
    7.- 22march:    Augmented reality with the informations of the parameters of the camera prepviously calibrated.

Task 2 
    1.- 8 february: intial presentation about article choosen for each group, higlight main idea of the article, algorithms and mathematics bases and define the complexity.
